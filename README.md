LLM Science Research Assistant for High Schoolers

# Disclaimer and Warning 
**Disclaimer This project and tool is used with the intention as an assistant but not as a mechanism to violate your school's honor code. Remember, if you use this tool to cheat, you are only cheating your own mind and learning potential:

# Setting up OpenAI
input your own OpenAI API token in the space "your key here" to get access to GPT-3.5

# Purpose and Function 
My code involves a multistep process with the objectives of 1) Breaking down complicated terms, 2) Simplifying laboratory techniques and methods, 3) Teaching High Schoolers how to apply those techniques, 4) Connecting High Schoolers with Like-Minded researchers and programs

# Paper Summary
Before getting too complicated, it is necessary to have somewhat of a foundational understanding of the paper (or at least its objective)
The first tool uses a thoughtfully engineered prompt to summarize the objective of the paper, using unique analogies that are cohesive for a high schooler. Additionally, understanding the objective of the paper lays a framework for the student to understand the complex intricacies and findings of the paper by having a general sense established. 

# Enhanced Glossary
Honestly, this prompt took some extensive prompt engineering, but I kept persevering until it worked. The second prompt defines medical and biological terms in the paper and breaks them down with simple, easy-to-understand analogies. By understanding key vocabulary, students can better understand the objective of the paper by using their own brain power, coupled with AI's push. Essentially, it's a glossary with an added explanation.

# Self-Driven Exploration
By now, students should have a strong understanding of the paper as they are familiar with the concepts and objectives. The third prompt allows students to fully understand the methods and research aspect of the paper by providing insight into how these experiments can be conducted at home and in a lab. This prompt provides the student with the equipment that they can use to further their understanding of this subject. Ultimately, it gets students thinking about the world of research and self-driven exploration. 

# Research Opportunities 
The next part of the third prompt actually provides areas where students can further their knowledge of the topic that interests them. Through thoughtfully created prompts, students are given a comprehensive list of summer programs and research opportunies exploring that given topic. Furthermore, this promotes the value of making an impact through your knowledge, giving students a push. 

# Like-Minded Researchers
The final prompt builds off of the previous prompt in an effort to get students more engaged in the world of research. As students provide their topic of interest, they receive a diverse array of researchers actively investigating that topic. The LLM factors in diversity, in this case it considers location, background, and gender to not give a monotonous mix of researchers
